# Notepad++ plugins
NotePad++ is a very nice and fast text editor for programming that I like to use for many tasks.
I decided to write some plugins to implement functionality that I desired to have and could not find otherwise.
For this reason most of the functions are targeted to my type of use and only few reasonable requests from users have been included because I found them useful to have, they were reasonably easy to implement, and the intrigued me.
